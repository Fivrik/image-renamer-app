üîß ONE-TIME SETUP INSTRUCTIONS üîß
========================================

Hi Mom! You need to do this ONCE before using the app:

STEP 1: CREATE THE API KEY FILE
--------------------------------
1. You should be in the folder where you unzipped the files
   (You'll see files like "Instructions_for_Mom.txt" and "üéØ START AI IMAGE RENAMER.bat")

2. Right-click in an empty space in the folder

3. Click: New ‚Üí Text Document

4. Name it EXACTLY: .env
   (Yes, it starts with a dot! Windows might warn you - that's OK, click "Yes")

5. Open the .env file in Notepad

6. Copy and paste this ENTIRE line (I'll send you the actual key separately):
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

7. Save the file (Ctrl+S) and close Notepad

STEP 2: TEST IT WORKS
----------------------
1. Double-click "üéØ START AI IMAGE RENAMER.bat"
2. If it works, your browser will open!
3. If you see "API KEY MISSING" error, check that you saved the .env file correctly

========================================
THAT'S IT! You only need to do this ONCE!
========================================

After this setup, you can just double-click
"üéØ START AI IMAGE RENAMER.bat" anytime to use the app!
