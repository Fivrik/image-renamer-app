# Reminder Updates for People Tagging

## ✅ Added Helpful Reminders for Your Mom

I've added several reminders throughout the app to help your mom remember to tag people before using the renamer:

### 🏠 Main App Page
**Prominent blue info box** displayed at the top of the app:

```
💡 Pro Tip: Tag People First!

For best results, tag people in your photos using Windows Photo Gallery
or similar software before uploading. The app will use your exact tags
and fall back to AI detection for untagged photos.

✅ Tagged photos → Uses your names | 🤖 Untagged photos → Uses AI detection
```

### 📖 Updated README Instructions
**Enhanced "How to Use" section:**

1. **Tag people first** (recommended): Use Windows Photo Gallery or similar software to tag people in your photos
2. Upload images: Click "Choose Files" to select photos
3. Process images: The app will use your existing tags or AI detection, extract dates, and generate descriptive names
4. Download: Get your renamed images with smart filenames

**Added new section:**
```markdown
### 💡 Important: Tag People Before Using the App
For the best results, tag people in your photos first using:
- Windows Photo Gallery (recommended)
- Adobe Bridge or Lightroom
- Any software that saves people tags to XMP metadata

The app will:
- ✅ Use your exact tags for photos you've already tagged
- 🤖 Use AI detection as a fallback for untagged photos
```

### 📱 Per-Photo Reminders
**Individual photo cards now show helpful tips** when no embedded tags are found:

```
📭 No people tags found
Tip: Tag people in Windows Photo Gallery first for better results!
```

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

Now when your mom uses the app:

1. **First Visit** → Sees prominent reminder about tagging people first
2. **Uploads untagged photos** → Individual cards remind her about tagging
3. **Uses tagged photos** → App celebrates with "Tagged: Mom, Sarah (From Windows Photo Gallery)"
4. **Reads README** → Clear instructions about tagging workflow

## 📋 Benefits of These Reminders

✅ **Educational**: Teaches your mom the optimal workflow
✅ **Non-intrusive**: Helpful blue info boxes, not annoying popups
✅ **Contextual**: Specific reminders appear when relevant
✅ **Encouraging**: Celebrates when she does tag people
✅ **Clear**: Simple language explaining the benefits

## 🎉 Perfect Workflow for Your Mom

1. **Take photos** with her camera/phone
2. **Import to Windows Photo Gallery**
3. **Tag people** in the photos she wants to organize
4. **Upload to the renamer app** → Gets smart filenames with her exact tags
5. **Upload untagged photos** → Still works with AI fallback + helpful reminder

This encourages the optimal workflow while still providing a great experience for photos she hasn't tagged yet!
