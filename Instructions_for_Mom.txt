TROUBLESHOOTING
=================================================
- If the browser doesn't open automatically, go to: http://localhost:3000
- If you see any error messages, close everything and try again
- Make sure you have a good internet connection (the AI needs it)

=================================================
WHAT THE AI DOES
=================================================
The AI looks at your pictures and creates descriptive names like:
- "sunset_over_mountains.jpg"
- "birthday_cake_with_candles.jpg"
- "golden_retriever_playing_fetch.jpg"

This makes it much easier to find your photos later!
